### About me

Hello, I'm Mert. I'm the founder and manager of Partivo Company.

My passion for the world of software started in 2019, and I've been actively working in this field ever since. During my time at Partivo, I've specialized in modern web technologies such as React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

However, my interests go beyond technical expertise. My involvement in areas such as politics and human relations shapes my perspective, and I strive to make Partivo not only a technology-driven company, but also a socially conscious one.

I'm someone who is constantly striving to learn and improve. Keeping up with new technologies and staying on top of the latest trends is crucial for me to support Partivo's vision and mission. I want to contribute to both the company's and my personal growth by participating in projects that align with our goals and enhance Partivo's success.
